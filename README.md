# Particle detachment models prediction web app 
This web app is using python and Flask web framework to run on the web. 
Bokeh plugin is used for the plots.
“MATLAB engine on python” is used to run the MATLAB functions.
The program evaluates critical shear velocity required for sub-micron particle detachment from the substrate. It uses physics-based particle detachment models for smooth and rough surfaces available in the literature.
